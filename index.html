        <p>Hi! I'm Amanda Sakuma. I am an editor and writer based in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>For the past decade, I've worked as a journalist covering politics, immigration, and social justice. Most recently, I edited a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/climate-crimes">special series</a> at The Guardian US focused on fossil fuel industry and its role in driving the climate crisis.</p>
        <P>My journalism career offered me many exciting opportunities, but now it's time for a new adventure. I'm looking forward to transitioning into the tech world.</P>
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy sewing, playing Minecraft, and tending to my growing collection of indoor plants.</p>
        <p>I grew up on a berry farm in Washington state and now live in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
